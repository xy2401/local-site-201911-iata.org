In March 2017, Safety Management SARPs were strengthened when ICAO adopted the first amendment to Annex 19, which will need to be implemented by November 2019. The amendment broadens the scope\nof the Annex, including, among other areas, a requirement for service providers to develop\nand promote a positive Safety Culture. Only a few airlines conduct such surveys, mainly using internal resources, with no ability to benchmark their safety culture against the industry globally. Recognizing this gap, IATA initiated the development of the I-ASC survey to provide participants with the means to meet ICAO requirements through a standardized tool. The survey was developed with the aim of creating an industry-wide standardized questionnaire to facilitate measurement and benchmarking from various perspectives. It can be used by airlines, GSPs, airports and ANSPs.\nWhat is I-ASC?\nI-ASC is an internal company employee survey on safety culture. It is an easy-to-use, aviation specific product with benchmarking capabilities, allowing customers to gain insight on their corporate safety culture without committing internal resources.\nI-ASC was developed through the collaboration of IATA and Cranfield University, a British postgraduate and research-based university. The survey is supported by one of the world’s leading market research firms: Ipsos.\nAvailable for computer and mobile devices,\nwith an optional paper version, I-ASC includes\na detailed communication plan and standard report. The report provides a detailed breakdown of results with actionable signposts for areas of improvement and excellence, while maintaining confidentiality of responses.\nAvailable in the six official ICAO languages,\nI-ASC consists of 60 questions grouped in nine categories aligned with ICAO’s SMS framework and relevant IOSA Standards and Recommended Practices (ISARPs). Results can be analyzed by hierarchy, years of service, geography, department, etc.\nWhat are the benefits of I-ASC?\n• Supports compliance with SMS and audit recommendations\n• Provides actionables\n• Aligns with the ICAO SMS framework, James\nReason Safety Culture model and ISARPs • Provides a cost-effective turnkey solution • Identifies safety culture gaps and helps\naddress them proactively\n• Provides industry benchmarking capabilities:\n- Against other organizations in the aviation industry\n- Against the industry on multiple levels: global, region, country, alliance*\n• Provides internal benchmarking capabilities: - Against past performance to demonstrate improvement\n- Against other divisions/departments\n• Improves employee safety awareness, engagement and adherence to safety procedures\n* Subject to relevant data availability\n  Icelandair CEO on I-ASC\n “It [the I-ASC survey] has proved beneficial to review the results with those in the different business entities, and similarly the divisions were able to compare themselves against others within the airline group. [...] The results documentation is presented in a format that was easy to digest, which made our feedback sessions more palatable for the audience. [...] In time, we look forward to options to compare the results achieved with those in other airlines-both in our region and further afield.” Michael Chapman, General Manager, Safety Systems, Virgin Australia\nTo find out more, visit iata.org/i-asc or contact us at iasc@iata.org\n","IMX - INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS\nSafety and quality in one click\nIntegrated Management Solutions (IMX) gathers all your quality management system (QMS) and safety management system (SMS) data in a single platform, enabling you to manage, analyze and control your data simply and easily.\nWhat is IMX?\nIMX is a software tool that gathers all quality and safety management data in a user-friendly format, enabling operators to effectively oversee and report on both QMS and SMS on a single electronic platform. Key features include:\n• Audits and findings management\n• Conventional, IOSA and ISAGO checklists\n• Risk assessment and root cause analysis\n• IOSA Conformance Report production\n• Safety reporting management\n• Offline auditing and reporting tools\n• Preloaded standardized taxonomy\nDeveloped in collaboration with airlines across different regions and available in the six official ICAO languages, IMX is fully aligned with ECCAIRS, allowing organizations to seamlessly report their data to the authorities.\nWhy do I need IMX?\nWith the increasing global demand for air transport, efficient operational quality and safety management are mandated by ICAO, IOSA, EASA, FAA and other regulatory bodies. And, operators invest considerable time, energy and\nresources in managing the diverse components and volume of data associated with QMS\nand SMS. By implementing the two systems\non a single platform, considerable efficiency improvements can be realized, along with other key benefits.\nHowever, the implementation of automated QMS and SMS can pose a significant challenge, particularly for small and medium-size operators, for whom implementation costs may be an obstacle. With its IMX software, IATA offers airlines and ground service providers a simple, efficient and cost-effective solution.\nImplementing IMX will help you:\n• Reduce potentially prohibitive implementation\ncosts for QMS and SMS automation\n• Boost QMS and SMS efficiency\n• Simplify quality and safety tracking, reporting\nand record-keeping\n• Enhance data analysis capabilitiest\n• Improve quality and safety regulatory\ncompliance\n• Exchange data with STEADES and GDDB\n• Support conformance with IOSA requirements\nSave time and money with a single platform.\nTo learn more about IMX, visit us at: www.iata.org/imx or email us at: imx@iata.org\n ","SKYFUSION\nHelping aviation connect!\nHelps drive practical air traffic management, notification and communication improvements, as well as bottom-line efficiencies, through a revolutionary collaborative decision-making and data exchange platform.\nWhy do we need SkyFusion?\nAs air traffic continues to grow, there is a need for the three main ATM stakeholders - airlines, ANSPs and airports - to ensure that efficiency improvements keep up with demand. SkyFusion effectively meets the challenges ahead by providing stakeholders with the ability to holistically connect, communicate, share data and make collaborative decisions at the regional and global level in real time.\nWhat is SkyFusion?\nSkyFusion is the collaborative effort of IATA and Harris Corporation, an American technology company.
