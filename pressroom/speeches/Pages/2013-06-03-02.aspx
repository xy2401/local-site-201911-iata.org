<p>United we stand, divided we fall. </p>
<p>It is a truth that has been with us for thousands of years. Since Aesop’s first fable, it has inspired change, revolution and forbearance in the face of adversity. </p>
<p>On 1 January 2014 we will celebrate 100 years of commercial aviation (1). Even for our relatively young industry this age-old truth has enormous relevance. Aviation is fiercely competitive. But, working together, strong partnerships, global standards and cooperation have played a major role in our success, and they still do. </p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>One of the longest standing partnerships between industry and governments is on safety. Flying is safer than ever.</p>
<p>Last year there was not a single hull loss with a Western-built jet&#160;(2) among our 240 member airlines or among the 387 airlines on the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) registry (3). </p>
<p>There is still more work to do. If we include all aircraft types (4), 2012 saw 75 accidents and 414 fatalities (5). These remind us of our great responsibility to those who trust us with their lives. And each accident re-dedicates both industry and governments to making flying even safer.</p>
<p>Geographically, the biggest challenge is Africa where the accident rate is 18 times worse than the global average (6). But the safety performance of African airlines on the IOSA registry, including our African members, aligns with the global average (7).</p>
<p>This means that world class safety is possible in Africa. With the Abuja Declaration (8), African governments have committed to achieve world class levels by the end of 2015. By then IOSA will be required across the continent (9). As partners, we are engaging African airlines directly to meet IOSA’s over 900 standards and join the registry. </p>
<p>And I hope that the European Union (EU) will be watching the results. Its banned list has not helped African safety (10). I am confident that IOSA will lead to improvements. And the EU will have no choice but to rethink its misguided approach.</p>
<h2>Financial Performance</h2>
<p>Compared to our safety performance, aviation’s ability to generate sustainable returns has been more challenging. This year we expect airlines to make $12.7 billion profits. On $711 billion in revenues, that’s a 1.8% net profit margin (11). And to put that into perspective, it means that we will earn a $4.00 (12) profit per passenger carried—less than the price of a sandwich in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>Generating even these small profits under current conditions is a major achievement. The price of fuel, our largest cost item, has increased 55% since 2006 (13). And we continue through the greatest period of economic stress since the 1930s. </p>
<p>Airlines have attacked costs and improved efficiencies. Industry programs such as e-ticketing, have contributed to the effort. This helped to keep unit cost increases to 23% (14). Intense competition means that fares have been unable fully to recoup cost increases.</p>
<p>So where are the profits coming from?</p>
<ul>
<li>Airlines found new value streams. Ancillary sales have grown to over 5%&#160;(15) of revenues.</li>
<li>And capacity is being used more efficiently. The industry load factor is at a record high of 80.3%.</li></ul>
<p>But, business is still tough. The day to day challenges of keeping revenues ahead of costs remain monumental. Many airlines are struggling. But there is a core of airlines that are driving profits with solid performance. </p>
<p>Our investors should be excited about the industry’s potential. With 3.1 billion (16) people and more than 52 million tonnes of cargo (17) expected to fly this year, air transport is a growing part of the fabric of modern life. Our activities generate some 57 million jobs (18), support $2.2 trillion in global business&#160;(19) and facilitate $6.4 trillion in trade (20). Looking ahead, the Asia-Pacific market could triple in size over the next 20 years (21). And you can only imagine the potential of Africa.</p>
<p>In our first 100 years aviation connectivity has recalibrated humanity’s mindset to a global scale. In doing so, aviation has enriched our world. The future is pregnant with potential. But it also holds many challenges.</p>
<p>Partnerships are critical to take advantage of the potential and to overcome the challenges. Successful partnership is built on transparency and common purpose. And sometimes frank words are required to strengthen alignment. I see five areas where this is needed today&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>Regulation, and </li>
<li>Environment.</li></ul>
<h2>Improving Security </h2>
<p>Starting with security, there is good alignment on what needs to be achieved. Our customers don’t want anything to do with terrorists or their weapons. Airlines don’t want them on their aircraft. Airports don’t want them on their premises. And governments don’t want them in their country. </p>
<p>What we lack is alignment on how to achieve this. There is, however, a growing recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach is wasteful and unsustainable. The vast majority of passengers and cargo pose no threat at all. So, we are working in partnership with governments on two key data-driven risk-based initiatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure Freight&#160;(22) has proved that a supply chain approach works. Six countries&#160;(23) have followed a successful pilot in Malaysia. And more will follow. </li>
<li>A framework for the Checkpoint of the Future (24) has been agreed and component testing is progressing. Passengers can expect to see the first versions operational as early as next year (25).</li></ul>
<p>Despite this good progress, we must also be open with our government partners about our frustrations. Lack of harmonization is the issue. For example&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>Governments agreed on an Advance Passenger Information (API)&#160;(26) standard which has been endorsed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (27). But that hasn’t solved our issues with API. Seven&#160;(28) of the 42 states requiring API don’t use the standard. And at least five more are considering unique requirements. On top of that, the UAE and Canada require airlines to provide data – then charge them lots of money for doing so (29).&#160;</li>
<li>Similarly, despite agreement on the principles for one-stop-security being long-established, we only see progress in a few regions (30). If you screen passengers thoroughly and keep them in a sterile environment, a second check is a waste of resources. So why aren’t more states moving more quickly in this direction?</li></ul>
<p>Governments work together with trust and cooperation on safety. It’s time to apply the same approach for security to achieve a harmonized, efficient and effective outcome.</p>
<h2>Cost Effective and Efficient Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Looking beyond security to overall infrastructure, partnerships also play a key role. Airlines depend on airports, air navigation service providers (ANSPs) and ultimately governments to ensure sufficient infrastructure capacity at economic prices.</p>
<p>Many understand that connectivity is a strategic economic driver—Singapore, China, Chile, the UAE, South Korea, Hong Kong and so on. It’s a familiar list of well-connected economies thriving with excellent airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>But what’s happening in other parts of the world drives me mad with frustration. And you too, I’m sure. </p>
<p>The Single European Sky (SES) (31), for example, is not materially any closer to realization today than it was a year ago. In fact, you would have to be an extreme optimist to identify much progress at all over the last ten years. The European Commission understands the value that SES would bring. But EU member states are paralyzed by wrongly perceived national interests. And this is robbing Europe of the economic and environmental benefits that SES could deliver—a EUR 5 billion boost to competitiveness (32), eradication of nearly 18 million minutes of delay (33), an 8.1 million tonne reduction in carbon emissions&#160;(34) and the capacity to support economic growth efficiently.</p>
<p>What’s needed? Several things&#58; </p>
<ul>
<li>A binding performance scheme with an independent regulator&#160;(35)</li>
<li>&#160;Competition among providers (36)</li>
<li>A reduction in air traffic control centers from 63 to at most 40 (37), and</li>
<li>Guaranteed performance improvements using modern technology&#160;(38)</li></ul>
<p>NextGen in the US has taken too long to get off the ground as well (39), but it is finally gaining momentum. And the Seamless Asian Sky&#160;(40) initiative is seeking air traffic management solutions in advance of the situation becoming critical. Every year that SES is delayed, the gap with the rest of the world grows. And the solutions required become bigger and more complex.</p>
<p>Europe is also home to one of our biggest airport problems—Heathrow. And I am not even referring to the capacity issue. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has an enhanced mandate to protect the interests of passengers. To fulfill this, the CAA is proposing a Heathrow price cap of 1.3% below inflation for the next five years (41). This sets an important precedent. But even at that, it is weak medicine for a major illness. Capping prices at inflation minus 9.8% is possible if the airport and regulator focus on efficiency (42). And Heathrow’s response has not been what you would expect of an important business partner. </p>
<p>Disappointingly, and in a way only possible for a monopoly, it is threatening to cut capital expenditure to the detriment of service levels and operational resilience instead of getting serious about efficiencies. </p>
<p>Through ICAO governments have agreed on common sense principles to guide the critical partnership between airports, airlines, and governments on infrastructure (43). Infrastructure users—the airlines—should be engaged in transparent consultations so that what is built matches what is actually needed and at affordable costs.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, but there are plenty of examples to show how misalignment can turn fantastic partnership opportunities—like Heathrow—into a constant struggle on cost, service levels and capacity. When airlines, airports, ANSPs and governments work together, everyone benefits. And pragmatic government regulation can ensure that this happens systematically.</p>
<h2>NDC</h2>
<p>Cooperation among partners is also the basis for solving common problems. As everyone in this room knows, our passengers would benefit from modernizing airline distribution. Today’s reality is that travelers have one set of product options if they buy on an airline website. But if they choose to buy through our travel agent partners, the options are limited.</p>
<p>Agents get their offers from airlines via global distribution systems (GDSs) (44). Despite attempts to enrich content, GDSs struggle to communicate much more than the basics of fare, class and availability. That’s because the standards for the communication among these parties were developed before the internet and XML—today’s lingua franca for modern commerce.</p>
<p>To remedy the situation we are working with our travel industry partners to develop open XML standards that will enable a new distribution capability (NDC) (45). </p>
<p>The NDC foundation standard was agreed in late 2012. It’s been submitted to the US Department of Transportation (DOT)&#160;(46) for approval. And we are actively engaging regulators around the world to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the value that NDC will bring to the experience of buying travel though an agent—more choices, better quality information and the potential for personalized offers.</p>
<p>However, we are not without opponents. And, frankly, some of them are not telling the truth. Let me clear the air with some facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>NDC will not contravene privacy laws. Nothing in the NDC standard requires passengers to supply personal information to receive an offer. But it does provide the opportunity for customers to identify themselves to have their loyalty recognized by the airline – but only if they choose to do it.</li>
<li>NDC will not bypass travel agents. It will enable them to sell all of what airlines have on offer.&#160;</li>
<li>And, lastly, NDC will not eliminate comparison shopping. It will give customers better information on which to make decisions. NDC will support photographic product descriptions so that people can see what they are buying. And it will enable passengers to compare the base fare as well as the cost of all the options that are available.</li></ul>
<p>Momentum is building. We have a mock-up in the exhibition area. Please go and look at it. You’ll be able to see the kind of features NDC could enable for travel agents and their customers. The first pilots will be live before the year-end. Amadeus has expressed its support for the stated objectives of NDC, although it has some concerns about the Resolution (47). And Travelport has said that it will work with airlines that want to distribute products via NDC standards (48).</p>
<p>Later today, a resolution on NDC, if passed, will provide further clarity to governments and industry partners on our aims, objectives and commitment to change.</p>
<h2>Establishing appropriate regulation </h2>
<p>Partnerships with the travel industry are changing distribution for the better. We need similar partnerships with governments to change regulation for the better.</p>
<p>We have already shown that this is possible with safety regulation that underpins solid performance. But not all regulation delivers value. </p>
<p>What’s needed is a Hippocratic Oath for regulators. The first principle would be to do no harm—intended or unintended. And every regulator should take an oath to solve problems, take full advantage of expert advice, evaluate costs and benefits; and ensure global harmonization. </p>
<p>Some recent regulatory developments already align with this. For example we have seen regulations in Russia, India and Poland&#160;(49) that increase competition among airline suppliers at airports. And progressive liberalization is creating new opportunities for airlines to meet market needs. </p>
<p>But on passenger rights, regulators are getting it wrong. </p>
<p>It is a strange paradox&#58; We are a service industry that operates in a hyper-competitive environment. Yet governments feel they need to protect our customers from us. It is totally appropriate that governments set some simple guarantees. But that’s not what’s happening. Regulators—the guardians of competition—are micro-managing our businesses. And the rules can be so prescriptive that they stifle innovation. We have regulations that define&#58;</p>
<ul>
<li>How we advertise our services&#160;(50)</li>
<li>How long we must hold a reservation that has not been paid for (51), and</li>
<li>How we compensate and care for passengers when there are operational disruptions—regardless of the root cause (52)</li></ul>
<p>Most passenger rights regulations are centered on levying penalties or preventing activities rather than providing solutions. For example, we have different rules on how to compensate passengers for delays. But where are the regulations to fix the air traffic management issues that cause so many delays?</p>
<p>Already some 50 countries have passenger rights legislation (53). They are not aligned. And the bad news is that more states are considering joining in this daunting and diverse mess.</p>
<p>Overzealous regulation causes significant difficulty in domestic markets. And un-harmonized regulations can cause utter confusion for international travelers. Being delayed on a disrupted trip from the US to Israel via Europe is bad enough for passengers. Regulation shouldn’t make things even worse by presenting them with a bewildering array of three conflicting passenger rights regimes (55).</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to think that governments will fix the situation anytime soon. I’m afraid our vigorous objections haven’t got us very far. So, industry needs to provide a fresh solution. Later this morning we will consider a resolution on a set of core principles for passenger rights. </p>
<p>If agreed, this will become a valuable tool to guide governments in harmonizing their various regimes. And it would be the centerpiece of an industry–wide campaign to help regulators recalibrate their impression of what the air travel experience is, and how it could be even better. </p>
<p>We want regulators to understand that travelers are our customers. And we want customers to have the best possible experience, because our businesses depend on customers coming back.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Even more critical is the urgent need to address fast moving developments in the environment debate with a strong industry position.</p>
<p>As a global industry, aviation is already in the forefront. We recognize that reducing carbon emissions is a global challenge. And to be successful we know that we need global measures. </p>
<p>That’s why we united behind a global strategy based on improvements in technology, operations and infrastructure along with market-based-measures (MBMs) as a gap-filling measure. And, at the ICAO Assembly in 2010 governments agreed to important global and aspirational goals including carbon-neutral growth from 2020 - or CNG2020&#160;(56) as we call it.</p>
<p>Make no mistake. Our unity has delivered some major successes. We worked with industry partners to demonstrate that sustainable low-carbon fuels, including biofuels, are a real alternative to jet kerosene. And we are now pushing governments to provide the incentives needed for investors and our oil industry partners to be able to commercialize production at costs we can afford. </p>
<p>Unity also helped us to fend off the misguided attempt to bring international aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) (57). Europe stopped the clock at the end of 2012, creating the space for countries to agree on a global approach for MBMs through the ICAO process.</p>
<p>MBMs are critical to meeting our targets. Technology, operations and infrastructure improvements will not be enough for CNG2020, at least in its early years. </p>
<p>The ICAO Assembly this year will determine the way forward. It is a big challenge. And governments are asking us—as an industry—to present a common position to guide their deliberations. </p>
<p>Over the last two years IATA’s Climate Change Task Force&#160;(58) has taken up the challenge of forging that common position. But it is as much of a struggle for airlines as it is for governments. </p>
<p>The question is this. Can we, airlines, agree on a way to share the industry emissions bill, which, I must remind you, amounts only to the cost of the post-2020 growth? Or would we prefer to let governments around the world decide how to make us pay for all our emissions?</p>
<p>I know how I’d answer that, but you will be discussing it later this morning. </p>
<p>How should we divide up the industry bill? Is it fair that a smaller but growing airline should have to pay more than a much bigger airline, just because the bigger one got its growth in before 2020?&#160; </p>
<p>But would it also be fair if an airline which is not growing has to pay something, when the industry bill is calculated on the basis of growth? </p>
<p>Reasonable people can disagree about the answers. But if we cannot find a compromise we will lose a golden opportunity to give governments the guidance that many of them are asking us for. That means bridging the gap between those who say we should divide the bill based on your share of total emissions, and those who say we should divide the bill based on your share of growth.</p>
<p>As with any compromise, nobody will get everything that they want. But consider carefully the potential consequences of the alternative—the infamous patchwork horror story that will certainly unfold.</p>
<p>If we don’t agree, governments will decide on our behalf. Some will impose environmental taxes. The UK, Germany and Austria&#160;(59) already have. Others may focus on total emissions rather than just growth. A few may do nothing—an option that also creates competitive distortions. And others might find even more expensive ways to penalize emissions —possibly in ways that are completely disproportionate to our emissions contribution. </p>
<p>Without a united industry position we would cede the opportunity to influence governments on MBMs. And, we leave ourselves defenseless to fight what governments might come up with. </p>
<p>Now there’s no guarantee that what we say we want will be implemented. But if we don’t say what we want it’s certain we won’t like the outcome. </p>
<p>Governments are struggling to find a solution. And many are asking for our guidance. With these considerations, it is painfully obvious that it is in our individual and collective interests to let those governments know the direction in which we would like them to move.</p>
<p>Later today a resolution on sharing the burden of carbon-neutral growth will come before this assembly. As the leader of your association, I urge all in this room to maintain industry unity and support it. As partners, it’s time to focus on the common good. United we stand. Divided, we will all fall.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have to report that the state of global air transport remains challenging. Nevertheless, we are a resilient and robust industry with an important role in global development. </p>
<p>The 8.5 million people&#160;(60) and 143,000 tonnes of cargo&#160;(61) that are carried safely by air everyday are proof that aviation is integral to modern life and commerce. Connectivity drives economic growth. We bring products to markets, link people to business and reunite families and friends. We are truly a force for good.</p>
<p>Airlines compete vigorously to defend and grow their businesses. At the same time we have a strong association born in the recognition that a successful global air transport industry needs global standards. And that these standards must be built through compromise, partnership and cooperation.</p>
<p>The first century of commercial flight is marked by impressive achievements. Together, we will continue to face our many challenges. And united we will deliver many more successes—sustainably connecting and enriching our world as an industry that is ever safer, more secure and profitable.</p>
<p>Thank you.&#160;</p>
