<p><strong>Giovanni Bisignani, IATA's Director General and CEO</strong></p>
<p><strong>IATA Annual General Meeting and World Air Transport Summit<br>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong></p>
<p>Numbers can tell powerful stories. US$10.4 billion (1)&#160; is the amount we lost last year. The ground shifted and our industry was shaken. Skyrocketing oil prices dominated the first half of 2008. Global recession was the story of the second half. </p>
<p>2009 will also see massive shifts. We expect the industry fuel bill to fall by US$59 billion (2). But rising oil prices anticipating recovery are a great risk. Greedy speculation must not hold the global economy hostage. Failure to act by governments would be irresponsible. On top of this, an even bigger negative number is on the horizon&#58; US$80 billion (3). That is the total revenue that will disappear with falling demand, collapsing yields, broken consumer confidence, and pandemic fears. The landscape is harsh. Airlines will lose US$9 billion&#160;(4) this year.</p>
<p>How long must we travel the desert of global recession? There is no modern precedent for today’s economic meltdown. Cargo remains a good leading indicator. Its 23% freefall in December&#160;(5) was a clear sign that the global economy was collapsing. It has been stable at that level for five months. </p>
<p>This may be the bottom but recovery is different. Banks are still not able to finance business. US$1 trillion&#160;(6) is still needed to re-capitalize. Our customers don’t have confidence. They need to reduce debt and that means less cash to spend. Business habits are changing and corporate travel budgets have been slashed. Video conferencing is now a stronger competitor. </p>
<p>Optimists see growth by the end of the year but pessimists view this as a mirage and expect an L-shaped recovery. I am a realist. I don’t see facts to support optimism.</p>
<p>Our industry is in survival mode. Whether this crisis is long or short, the world is changing. Even if we try to look beyond the crisis we must recognize that it will not be business as usual. Change is critical. We must use this crisis as an opportunity for governments, partners and airlines to build a stronger industry.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting globalization</strong></p>
<p>The first challenge is to protect the engine of prosperity, the global village that we helped to build. Since 1950, the world’s economy&#160; grew six fold, but world trade is 22 times bigger (8) . This engine of growth increased incomes and reduced poverty. With global trade everybody wins. But the forces of de-globalization are gathering strength and governments are taking protectionist decisions. World trade is already suffering with a 15% downturn (9),&#160; depressing economies everywhere. Replacing the global village with islands of isolation would be a step backwards. Protectionism is the enemy of global prosperity. In the 1930s (10), it prolonged the depression and it will not work today. To secure our future and build a strong global economy we must fight hard to keep the world trading.</p>
<p><strong>Hope and Survival</strong></p>
<p>We must also fight to adapt our businesses. We are a resilient industry as a result of our ability to change. Some amazing numbers quantify our achievements over the last decade. We have seen a 71% increase in labor productivity (11), a 20% gain in fuel efficiency (12)&#160;, and a 7-point improvement in load factors (13). Despite these great achievements we are now in survival mode. Without compromising safety, security or environmental responsibility, conserving cash and cutting costs are at the top of the agenda.</p>
<p>Your association understands your needs. We are keeping your money safe. IATA’s financial systems handled US$350 billion last year (14). As airlines, agents and even banks failed, IATA did not miss a penny or a payment. </p>
<p>We helped airlines reduce costs by at least US$24 billion (15). This includes US$5 billion in fuel savings&#160;(16) and US$3.5 billion in charges, fees and taxes&#160; to name just two. We have aggressive targets for 2009&#58;&#160; US$1.5 billion in charges, fees and taxes (17), at least US$2 billion in fuel savings, and a significant reduction in BSP and CASS unit rates (18). </p>
<p>We don’t need a fortune teller or a magician to know that the assumptions of our past are no longer valid. After September 11, 2001, revenues fell by 7% (19). Almost immediately, we returned to growth that was fueled by strong economies. This time we face a 15% drop&#160;(20) with a global recession. It’s a different world. Our future depends on drastic resizing and reshaping by governments, partners and airlines to be even safer, greener and profitable.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<p>Already some strategies are clear&#58; <strong>Cash is king</strong>. Industry debt is high at US$170 billion (21)&#160;. But some of this has bought a US$70 billion cash cushion&#160;(22) that helped us avoid major bankruptcies. Partners help. Major mergers -- KLM-Air France, Lufthansa-Swiss, Delta-Northwest, JAL-JAS, Cathay Pacific-Dragonair -- created stronger competitors. Manage capacity. Our US colleagues cut quickly. As a result they are stronger. But international load factors are down 3 points (23). Each airline must make its own decision but we must all better match capacity to falling demand. Remember history. Once again aircraft ordered in good times are being delivered in recession. About 4,000 aircraft are scheduled for delivery over the next three years (24), which is 17% of the current fleet (25). Finding customers to fill them profitably will be a challenge. </p>
<p><strong>Reshaping the Industry</strong></p>
<p>There are many other challenges. Using them as opportunities, we must move the industry forward. The fall in revenues is an US$80 billion&#160;(26) case for change. Tightening belts is obvious. But the same product in a different size is not the answer. Shippers and travelers will expect greater value at reduced prices. The entire value chain must be involved in resizing and reshaping this industry.</p>
<p>Airlines have made a head start. IATA’s Simplifying the Business program delivered US$4 billion in savings last year and offered a better product with e-ticketing and CUSS (27). Now we are targeting a further US$10 billion annual savings by improving baggage, travel processes and shipping (28). But resizing and reshaping is not just a problem for airlines. Our partners live on our revenues and they must follow the same approach.</p>
<p><strong>For labor</strong>&#160; we cannot reshape without flexibility. This is not the time for salary increases. To protect jobs we must modernize work practices and we must all do more with less. </p>
<p><strong>For our 60,000 travel agents</strong>, the clock cannot be turned back. Travel is more accessible than ever in price and purchase options. To survive in the global online market you need to reshape your services and your business models to provide greater value that travelers are willing to pay for. </p>
<p>Airlines expect the same from <strong>all suppliers and manufacturers</strong>. They must reshape their products to reduce their costs and ours. Look at the global distribution systems. We cannot accept that those in the West charge around US$4 per transaction when China TravelSky does the same job for US$0.50. This must change. </p>
<p>Now let me spend some time on one of my special subjects. 11%&#160;(29) of your revenues go to <strong>monopoly suppliers</strong>. Airlines pay over US$54 billion to airports and air navigation service providers. Some are sharing the burden of change. To name just two in this region, Malaysia Airports reduced charges by 50% for two years&#160;(30) and Singapore reduced charges by 25% (31)&#160;. </p>
<p>The growing list of partners delivering good results includes the air traffic control providers for Ireland, Bulgaria, and Vietnam and airports in Dallas/Fort Worth, Geneva and Thailand. These helped us to achieve cost savings of US$357 million last year (32). But now my special subject becomes your nightmare. The bill that you paid to happy monopoly suppliers grew by US$1.5 billion&#160;(33) last year. In the first six months of 2009 as the industry crisis worsened it grew by another $1.5 billion (34).&#160; For the worst contributors to this increase we have a special place on the <strong>IATA Wall of Shame</strong>&#58; </p>
<ul>
<li>BAA and the UK CAA for London Heathrow’s 86% increase&#160;(35)&#160; </li>
<li>Delhi and Mumbai airports for their 207% increase&#160;&#160;(36) </li>
<li>Quiport in Ecuador for its 79% increase&#160;&#160;(37) </li>
<li>ATNS (South Africa) for proposing a 44% increase&#160;(38) </li>
<li>The Eurocontrol States of Denmark, The Netherlands and Poland for proposing charges increases between 27% and 32% (39)</li></ul>
<p>What can I say? BASTA (Enough)!&#160; There is no room for this nonsense in our future. When demand drops, suppliers cannot divide the same costs among fewer customers. The shape of everything must change. This includes the comfortable position of our happy monopoly suppliers. I invite all of you to join me in a strong declaration from Kuala Lumpur to all of our partners contemplating increases. Once more, BASTA!</p>
<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>
<p>The biggest job in resizing and reshaping is our relationship with governments. It starts with climate change. Even in a recession, environment is at the top of our agenda. <strong>No other industry is as ambitious</strong>. Two years ago, I announced a vision to achieve carbon-neutral growth on the way to a carbon-free future. <strong>No other industry is as united</strong>. Our four-pillar strategy&#160;(40) focuses all industry players on addressing climate change together. <strong>And no other industry has achieved so much</strong>. Seven percent is how much our emissions will fall this year (41)&#160;. Five percent&#160;(42)&#160; from reduced capacity as a result of the recession and 2%&#160;(43) is a result of our strategy. </p>
<p>Look at our amazing work on biofuels. They have the potential to reduce our carbon footprint by up to 80% . IATA set a target of 10% alternative fuels by 2017 (45). Nobody thought it possible but four airlines have tested biofuels, making certification a reality by 2011 . But where are governments? Of the trillions of dollars in stimulus funds there is nothing on aviation biofuels.</p>
<p>The US is investing US$25 million in research&#160;(47) but it’s peanuts. Governments are not providing the right incentives and oil companies who cashed US$48 billion in refinery margins from aviation&#160;(48) are not moving fast enough. Their investment in alternative fuels is also peanuts. </p>
<p>But if governments are too slow to invest they are too fast to tax. US$6.9 billion is what governments added to our tax bill&#160;(49) when everybody else was getting tax breaks.</p>
<p>Some governments are learning. The EUR 318 million Dutch tax cost the economy EUR 1.2 billion&#160;(50) but did nothing for the environment. The Dutch had the good sense to abolish it. I wish that I could say the same for the UK where Air Passenger Duty was increased to GBP 2.7 billion (51). It is unacceptable that money collected from our responsible industry in the name of the environment is being used by an irresponsible government to pay inflated MP expense claims or bail out banks.</p>
<p>We must look to the future. Both the aviation industry and governments want to improve environmental performance. It’s an opportunity to work together. Our industry has made significant commitments with concrete targets. The first is to improve fuel efficiency by 1.5%&#160;(52) each year until 2020. But we recognize that improved fuel efficiency is not enough. Our emissions must stop growing.</p>
<p>Yesterday our Board took a landmark decision. By 2020, the airline industry will achieve carbon neutral growth (53). Demand will continue to increase but any expansion of our carbon footprint will be compensated. </p>
<p>We can be proud. Airlines are the first global industry to make such a bold commitment. But we cannot do it alone. ICAO must define binding carbon emissions standards for manufacturers. Air navigation service providers must make it possible to fly even more effectively. Fuel companies must supply eco-friendly fuels and governments must give us access to credits in global carbon markets.</p>
<p>To manage this global sectoral approach (54)&#160;, we must account for emissions at a global level, not by state. IATA will work with ICAO to ensure compliance. Airlines should get carbon credits for every cent they pay whether in taxes, charges or emissions trading scheme payments. We should pay only once, not several times. </p>
<p>With our commitments and a strong vision we can be proud of going farther and faster than any other industry. We are showing the way with carbon neutral growth. The industry is a role model for others to follow. The challenge will be for governments to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Governments—The Bigger Relationship</strong></p>
<p>Reshaping the approach to climate change is only the start. Our relationship with governments must move from punitive micro-regulation to joint problem solving. Governments must understand that we can help them protect their citizens, improve efficiency, save jobs, and support economic growth, but only if we work together. </p>
<p><strong>Governments want to protect their citizens</strong>. We can help, but we need better coordination. US$5.9 billion is the airline security bill (55). We must spend our money more wisely focusing on the threats, not the 99.9% of our passengers who are not a risk. One-stop security must be the future (56)&#160;. Europe is moving quickly in this direction for intra-European flights. France was the latest to join&#160;(57) this initiative. Why don’t all governments take the same approach so that the million passengers a day&#160;(58) who make connections are not checked twice?&#160; The time has come for harmonization and mutual recognition of standards. </p>
<p><strong>Governments want to reduce delays.</strong> We can help but we need efficient infrastructure. Slot auctions and legislation on passenger rights are not the solution. The trillions in stimulus monies are a great opportunity to improve infrastructure. Airlines are already investing billions of dollars for advanced avionics. After decades of talks, a Single European Sky&#160;(59) is closer than ever. I hope that President Obama can make NextGen a reality (60)&#160;. Combined, these programs can save 41 million tonnes of CO2 and over US$21 billion (61), but only if governments deliver. </p>
<p><strong>Governments want to protect jobs and stimulate the economy.</strong> We can help but we need basic commercial freedoms to run our businesses. Look at how other industries are dealing with the crisis. Banks are getting capital not just from bailouts but also from international markets. Chrysler’s cross-border partnership with Fiat is building a new future for both. </p>
<p>Let me be clear. We don’t want bailouts. All we want is access to global capital, but old rules&#160;(62) stand in the way of a healthier industry. If we cannot pay the bills, saving the flag on the tail will not save jobs. A prolonged recession could lead to a cash crisis. This would put at risk 32 million jobs (63)&#160; and the lifeblood of the global economy.</p>
<p>What is the opportunity for our future? Progressive liberalization. It would be a cheap and effective stimulus. When it started in the US, it made travel accessible. When Europe liberalized, 1.4 million jobs were created (64). Liberalizing key routes today would create 24 million jobs and US$490 billion in economic activity (65)&#160;. </p>
<p>The logical next step is for the US and Europe to expand Open Skies to Open Aviation (66). The new administrations in the US and the next European Commission must not miss a great opportunity. An agreement would strengthen their industries and send a strong signal of change beyond their borders. Access to markets and capital is critical to all of our businesses. Later this year, IATA’s Agenda for Freedom will deliver an important policy tool, with governments signing a multilateral statement of policy principles.</p>
<p>For our industry with US$48 billion&#160;(67) in losses since 2001 the time for change is now. Governments must understand that the survival of the industry is at risk. They must deliver normal commercial freedoms urgently and effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p>In a changing world one aspect of our business is rock solid. That is our commitment to safety. Last week’s tragedy over the South Atlantic reminded us all that safety is a constant challenge. Last year, our industry had an amazing achievement. We flew 2.2 billion people safely (68)&#160;. Our goal must always be to do even better&#58; zero accidents, zero fatalities. In 2006, this assembly took an historic decision. You made IOSA&#160;(69) a condition of membership. Our goal was to raise the bar on safety in every corner of the planet. We set targets and we worked with airlines from&#160;Korea to Africa and Latin America (70)&#160;. With your commitment and your hard work we are a quality association. We have a great number to celebrate&#58; 226. That is the number of IATA member airlines and all are on the IOSA registry (71). Congratulations to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We are a responsible industry in good times and in crisis. Today’s situation is unprecedented, the most difficult ever. Governments and partners must understand that we are struggling to survive with a new and harsh reality. We are, however, resilient and capable of great change. Together we must turn challenges into opportunities to be safer, greener and profitable.</p>
